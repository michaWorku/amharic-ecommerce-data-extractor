        "# FinTech Vendor Scorecard Development\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements the FinTech Vendor Scorecard for Micro-Lending.\n",
        "It combines entities extracted by the NER model with Telegram post metadata\n",
        "(views, timestamps, channel/vendor name) to create a rich profile for each vendor.\n",
        "It then calculates key performance metrics and a weighted \"Lending Score\" for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a core component of the FinTech E-commerce Data Extractor project,\n",
        "specifically designed to fulfill the business objective of identifying promising\n",
        "vendors for micro-lending opportunities within the EthioMart ecosystem.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Goal:** To leverage unstructured Telegram e-commerce data to provide\n",
        "data-driven insights for financial decision-making, particularly micro-lending.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Objective:** Enable EthioMart to make informed micro-lending decisions\n",
        "by quantifying vendor performance and potential based on their digital footprint\n",
        "and engagement on Telegram channels. This aims to reduce risk and optimize lending\n",
        "to active and successful small businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology:**\n",
        "The methodology integrates several stages of data processing and analysis:\n",
        "1. **Data Integration:** Utilizes preprocessed Telegram message data, incorporating\n",
        "critical metadata such as message views, posting message_dates, and channel information.\n",
        "2. **Entity Extraction:** Employs a fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) model\n",
        "to accurately extract crucial business entities (Product, Price, Location, Contact Info)\n",
        "from the free-form Amharic text of Telegram posts.\n",
        "3. **Vendor Analytics Engine Development:** Constructs a robust analytics engine\n",
        "to compute key performance indicators for each vendor, transforming raw data\n",
        "and extracted entities into quantifiable metrics.\n",
        "4. **Lending Score Formulation:** Develops a composite \"Lending Score\" by normalizing\n",
        "and weighting selected performance indicators, providing a single, interpretable\n",
        "metric to rank vendors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation Details:**\n",
        "This notebook orchestrates the following implementation steps:\n",
        "- Loading of preprocessed Telegram data and the custom-trained NER model (from a Hugging Face repository or local path).\n",
        "- Performing high-throughput NER inference across all available messages to enrich vendor profiles with extracted product and pricing information.\n",
        "- Calculating vendor-specific metrics including:\n",
        "  - **Posting Frequency:** Measuring the regularity and volume of a vendor's posts.\n",
        "  - **Average Views per Post:** Quantifying the reach and engagement of a vendor's content.\n",
        "  - **Average Price Point:** Analyzing the typical pricing of products offered, indicating market segment.\n",
        "  - **Top Performing Post Analysis:** Identifying the most successful posts and their associated product-price pairs.\n",
        "- Normalizing these metrics and applying predefined weights to compute the final \"Lending Score\".\n",
        "- Presenting a comprehensive summary table of the calculated metrics and Lending Scores,\n",
        "sorted for immediate business insights, along with detailed interpretations of the results."

A higher average price point might indicate a vendor dealing in higher-value, lower-volume products (e.g., electronics, specialized machinery), while a lower average price point could suggest a high-volume, lower-margin business (e.g., common household goods, fast-moving consumer goods). This helps lenders understand the scale and nature of the business.\n",
