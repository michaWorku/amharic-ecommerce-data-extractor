Welcome to FinTech E-commerce Data Extractor's Documentation!
===============================================================

This project aims to transform unstructured text data from Amharic e-commerce Telegram channels into structured, machine-readable information. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Large Language Models (LLMs), the system extracts key business entities such as product names, prices, locations, and contact information. This structured data is then used to populate a centralized database and, critically, to develop a "Vendor Scorecard" for FinTech micro-lending assessment.

The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive view of vendor activity and engagement, enabling data-driven decisions for potential loan offerings to active and promising e-commerce businesses on Telegram.
